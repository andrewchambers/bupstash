Need to do:

- Add --version and/or version.
- Document required rust version.
- Improve documentation on key exchange packet and 'box' structure.
- Editing of items - work out a scheme that is either backwards compatible, OR implement it.
- Verify we handle atime correctly when snapshotting.
- Hardlink support?
- Torture test in cli suite for send checkpointing duration.
- Send permission denied: Permission denied (os error 13), add path to error message.
- Tarball sort by extension to group similar files.
- use $(pwd) in docs to avoid relative paths.
- Change timestamp to date or time?

Can do later (medium term):

- Repository hooks:
  - Repository propagation/fan out. I want to be able to forward backups from my external drive
  - to my remote drive for example.

- Proper text wrapping of command help strings.

- Localization
  - tests for localized tags.

- Tests shouldn't depend on bash.

- Should allow running of single cli tests.

- busy timeout or other mechanism for send log and query cache.

- Concurrent garbage collector, walk htrees in parallel and/or walk multiple entries
  in parallel.

- Incremental garbage collector.

- Sparse file support in snapshots.

- Writing to broken pipe for 'list' and 'put' should be a failure, but not a panic or error message.

- Document precedence.

- Ways to tune chunking algorithm.
  - Fixed size chunking?
  - Min size/max size/average size?
  - Alternative chunking algorithms?

Long term:

Unclassified:

- no stored items with the requested id, send end of transmittion.

- Prefetch system should also work for non leaf tree nodes.

- failure error package is deprecated.

- Man page headers too big on site.

- Don't scroll in man examples.

- Synopsis into a single formatted rectangle on bupstash.1

- Consider a single larger man page.

- Way to untar? Perhaps just use system tar? What about
  windows? Maybe minitar ? Maybe link in a tar implementation.

- Man page quote all glob examples.

- Decouple compression and encryption code. Compression context?
