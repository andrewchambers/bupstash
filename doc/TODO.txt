Need to do:

- Document required rust version.
- Improve documentation on key exchange packet and 'box' structure.
- Hardlink support?
- Torture test in cli suite for send checkpointing duration.
- Send permission denied: Permission denied (os error 13), add path to error message.

Can do later (medium term):

- Repository hooks:
  - Repository propagation/fan out. I want to be able to forward backups from my external drive
  - to my remote drive for example.

- Proper text wrapping of command help strings.

- Localization
  - tests for localized tags.

- Should allow running of single cli tests.

- busy timeout or other mechanism for send log and query cache.

- Sparse file support in snapshots.

- Document precedence.

- Ways to tune chunking algorithm.
  - Fixed size chunking?
  - Min size/max size/average size?
  - Alternative chunking algorithms?

Long term:

Unclassified:

- no stored items with the requested id, send end of transmittion.

- Prefetch system should also work for non leaf tree nodes.

- Consider a single larger man page.

- Way to untar? Perhaps just use system tar? What about
  windows? Maybe minitar ? Maybe link in a tar implementation.

- Man page quote all glob examples.

- Decouple compression and encryption code. Compression context?
