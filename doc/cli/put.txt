`bupstash put` encrypts a file, directory, or command output and stores it
in a bupstash repository such that only the primary backup key can decrypt it.

For single files the contents are saved directly, for multiple files the data
is saved such that is can be retrieved as a tar archive, and for commands the
command is executed and stdout is sent to the repository.

To do incremental puts you must give each job you intend to run
repeatedly it's own send log. This can dramatically reduce the amount of 
disk reading and network usage required to make a snapshot.

Examples:
  $ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=$HOME/bupstash-repo
  $ export BUPSTASH_KEY=./my-secret-bupstash.key

  # To avoid resending data needlessly during backups, create job specific send log.
  $ bupstash put --send-log /root/backup-sendlog ./to-backup

  # Specify arbitrary metadata as KEY=VALUE using '-t'/'--tag'.
  # Can be specified multiple times.
  # Note that the `name` tag has an automatically generated default value (which is overidden in this example),
  # this can be deactivated with `--no-default-tags`.
  $ bupstash put -t name=MyBackup -t host=$(hostname) ./file.txt

  # Multiple files and directories can be saved at once.
  $ bupstash put ./file1.txt ./file2.txt ./some-dir

  # You can use '--' to separate options and paths.
  $ bupstash put -- --weird-file-name.txt

  # Use --exec to save the output of commands.
  # '--' here is optional but helps with readability.
  $ bupstash put --exec -t name=files.tar -- tar -C ./files -cvf - .

  # Put from stdin (does not check error codes).
  $ echo data | bupstash put -
