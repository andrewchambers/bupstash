bupstash-diff(1) 
================

## SYNOPSIS

Diff two snapshots printing the summary to stdout.

`bupstash diff [OPTIONS] QUERY1... :: QUERY2... `

## DESCRIPTION

`bupstash diff` fetches two snapshot listings from the remote server and compares them, printing
the diff line output to stdout. 

`bupstash diff` is preferred over running traditional `diff` against the output of `bupstash list-contents`
because it takes the full precision of timestamps and also the stored file hash into account when performing
the diff operation.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Output is consistent with that of `bupstash list-contents`, except each line is
prefixed with either `+` or `-` representing removed or added items respectively.

Specifying `--format` alters the underlying output format as described by bupstash-list-contents(1). Lines are still prefixed with either `+` or `-` regardless of the output format.

## QUERY LANGUAGE

For full documentation on the query language, see bupstash-query-language(7).

## QUERY CACHING

The diff command uses the same query caching mechanisms as bupstash-list(1), check that page for
more information on the query cache.

## OPTIONS

* -r, --repository REPO:
  The repository to connect to, , may be of the form `ssh://$SERVER/$PATH` for
  remote repositories if ssh access is configured. If not specified, is set to `BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY`.

* -k, --key KEY:
  Key used to decrypt data and metadata. If not set, defaults
  to `BUPSTASH_KEY`.

* --query-cache PATH:
  Path to the query-cache file, defaults to one of the following, in order, provided
  the appropriate environment variables are set, `$BUPSTASH_QUERY_CACHE`,
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/.cache/bupstash/bupstash.qcache` or `$HOME/.cache/bupstash/bupstash.qcache`.

* --format FORMAT:
  Set output format to one of the following 'human', 'jsonl'.

* --utc-timestamps:
  Display and search against timestamps in utc time instead of local time.

* -q, --quiet:
  Suppress progress indicators (Progress indicators are also suppressed when stderr
  is not an interactive terminal).

## ENVIRONMENT

* BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY:
  The repository to connect to. May be of the form `ssh://$SERVER/$PATH` for
  remote repositories if ssh access is configured.

* BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY_COMMAND:
  A command to run to connect to an instance of bupstash-serve(1). This 
  allows more complex connections to the repository for less common use cases.

* BUPSTASH_KEY:
  Path to a primary key that will be used for decrypting data and metadata.

* BUPSTASH_KEY_COMMAND:
  A command to run that must print the key data, can be used instead of BUPSTASH_KEY
  to fetch the key from arbitrary locations such as the network or other secret storage.

* BUPSTASH_QUERY_CACHE:
  Path to the query cache file to use.

## EXAMPLES

### Compare two snapshots by query

```
$ bupstash diff id="14eb*" :: id="57de"
- -rw-r--r-- 1191 hello.txt
+ -rw-r--r-- 1191 goodbye.txt
```
